A team retrospective is not just another useless meeting, and if you feel so, it means you are doing it wrong, and this article is for you.

With more than 10 years of experience as a Software Engineer, I had the amazing opportunity to attend hundreds of team retrospectives, and let me tell you one thing: it is the most important team meeting you could have if you know how to do it properly.

## Why is it important? 🎩

A retrospective is the time when a team can learn from its own mistakes, share gratitude, celebrate and talk about new ideas. Do you see the potential? 📈

### We are continuously doing something wrong ❌

Do you either see in the team something that can be improved or that is bothering you and the rest of the team?   
Raise your hand. This is the moment to speak up and talk about it.

### What if? 🤔

Do you have new ideas? Do you want to try something new and want to have the whole team opinion? Go for it!

### Celebration!! 🥳

Does your team achieve an accomplishment, do you want to say thank you to a specific person that help you ? (making it in public is better😉)

### Something went wrong 🙅

This is the most important reason: it makes the team to reflect upon something that happened in the past that went wrong.

> **Caution**
> It is about continous improvement, **not blaming**.
{: .callout .warn}

In a safe environment we should aim to point our fingers towards processes that didn't work, **not towards people**.


## Team Psychological Safety

> **Important:** Establish Psychological Safety
> Psychological safety is a very important thing to have in your team, the aim to make the people feeling safe. This should be a priority, the sooner you have it in your team, the better.
{: .callout .warn}

Have people in the team who feel safe is one of the most important thing to have when we talk about team dynamics. These people will be transparent, honest and they will take risks.   
During a retro, we need people that have the courage to speak up and to address issues and talk about solutions and ideas. Without psychological safety we can't have it. If people don't feel safe, they will be afraid to be exposed and be accountable.

## Format 👾

Most of the people I talked with thought that there is only one effective retrospective format

![retro-default]({{ '/assets/images/posts/retro_default.png' | relative_url }})

Which is completely false, changing retrospective format depending on your team situation **is crucial** to get the most out of this ceremony.

Retros should be fun and effective, not all sprints look the same so why your retro should?

### Different formats?

There are lots of templates online that can be used, for example:
* [Fun Retrospectives](https://www.funretrospectives.com/category/retrospective/).
* [Neatro Retro templates](https://www.neatro.io/retrospective-templates/)


## Common Pitfalls 👎🏻

### Team members become spectators 🥱

Retrospectives being facilitated always by the same person (_usually the tech lead or the manager_), have always the same outcome: the team tends to get used to it and the retro becomes "another meeting that could have been an email".  They become just spectators, and instead of feeling that this ceremony is FOR them trying to make the most out of it, they start feeling that is someone else duty to do so.

> **Problem:** Always the same person facilitating the retro 🙅🏼‍♂️
> Usually the tech lead or the manager facilitates the retro, leaving the team out of this duty.
{: .callout .error}

> **Win:** Rotate 🔁
> Rotate the facilitator every 2/4 weeks, make the people responsible of facilitating the retro correctly and efficiently.
{: .callout .success}

> **Tip:** Automatic rotation 🤖
> Add an automatic bot to rotate the person who take the faciliator role for that specific time-window.

### Hearing always the same voice 🎙️

Common scenario, have a card with lots of votes but we hear just one or two people talking for the whole (time boxed) time. In general if a card has lots of votes it means that more than one person of team feel that it is a topic that they care about, and that they have something to say about it. My advice is to let start speaking who creates the card, and then call out someone else who added a vote to it. 

> **Question:** Anybody else?
> Does anybody want to add anything? Can we hear another opinion?
{: .callout .info}

Different people might have different reasons to vote a specific card and some people are more silent than others, the benefit of doing this might be:
1. We hear what the owner has to say
2. Hear others opinions (they vote it, they have at least one opinion about that topic)
3. Keep people engaged.

> **Problem:** Cards with lots of votes being tackled by a single person 🙅🏼‍♂️
>
> We have only one voice in the room.
{: .callout .error}

> **Win:** Let other people speak 🗣️
> Don't let the creator of the card to be the only one who gives its opinion, ask the rest of the team who voted the card to speak up and add more about the topic that is going to be tackle.
{: .callout .success}

> **Tip:** Involve silent people
> Try to involve people who didn't talk during the whole meeting, **but don't force them to do so**.

### Time-boxing 🍅

As a facilitator the timer is your best friend, it is your duty to keep the meeting rolling and on-time, making sure that the important topics are discussed and that some action items have been created. To do so, you need to have time-boxed discussions.
Whenever a discussion starts let's set 10 minutes to talk through the topic, if at the end of those 10 minutes the team is satisfied you can move on, otherwise just ask about adding up 5 minutes more.

> **Question:** What now?
> Shall we spend 5 more minutes on this topic or move on?
{: .callout .info}

Do it just once, and focus on finding an action item, then move to the following topic, it bring lots of overlooked benefits:
1. Force the team to focus on what really matter
2. Keep the timing under control
3. It allows to tackle more important topics

> **Problem:** Spending too much time on a single topic
>
> Spending most of our precious time talking just about one or two topics for the whole meeting
{: .callout .error}

> **Win:** Time-box discussions 🍅
> Set 10 minutes for each topic conversation, the aim is to find an action item.
> If 10 minutes are not enough, ask the team if they want to talk about the topic for more 5 minutes or if they are okay with the outcome.
{: .callout .success}

> **Tip:** Shared timers
> Try to use a timer that is visually shared with the team, (or just share your screen) so everybody is aware of the timing.
{: .callout .info}

### Anonymous Cards and Votes 🃏

Some people in the team have more influence than others, and this can easily harm a retro meeting. Within a team there are multiple dynamics and we have to always remember that those dynamics influence how we interact and work with each other.
