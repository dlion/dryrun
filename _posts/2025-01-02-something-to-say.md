This is a fresh start. Iâ€™ll write short, practical posts about:

- Go and distributed systems  
- Pragmatic engineering practices  
- Infra, tooling, and debugging notes

Expect hands-on examples, fewer buzzwords, and trade-offs called out explicitly.

```js
window.onload = () => {
  const director = new Director('gameCanvas');
  const pet = new Pet(window.STATE.IDLE);

  director.bg.onload = () => {
    const game = new Game(director, pet);
    game.loop();
  };
};
```
