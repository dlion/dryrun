description: "Why this blog exists and what I’ll write about."

This is a fresh start. I’ll write short, practical posts about:

- Go and distributed systems  
- Pragmatic engineering practices  
- Infra, tooling, and debugging notes

Expect hands-on examples, fewer buzzwords, and trade-offs called out explicitly.

```go
func f() {}
