## Work

- Building and shipping backend services (Go on AWS), with an emphasis on reliability and clear trade‑offs.
- Pushing for technical excellence: TDD, pair programming, CI/CD, and pragmatic observability.
- Writing small, practical posts to document lessons learned and useful patterns.

## Personal Life

- Reading and note‑taking; currently re‑visiting key chapters of “Designing Data‑Intensive Applications”.
- Exploring new places around Andalusia on weekends and carving out time for fitness.
- Keeping a simple setup: fewer tools, better habits, more focus.
